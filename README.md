# Library-managment-system
Library managment system is created in c++ language by me for library systems. this project is basically works for searching 
books in library . 
it gives the full details like floor num, rack num with full details if any user search for the books in library.
This system is designed in c++ language with the help of file handling , pointer , functions , class , constructor , destructor
etc. concept.i have tried to make a full managment system which helps the students to findthe books in library.
if you want to use this system simply download the Zip file then extract it and run in any compiler.
This system was created by me in 9 days and it works perfectly in most of the compiler.
